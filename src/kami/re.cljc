  "Regex as data — 'hiccup for patterns'. An EDN form compiles to a regex source string (and `re`
   to a platform Pattern/RegExp), so a sanitiser or parser rule is readable, composable data instead
   of opaque slashes. `.cljc` — same on shadow-cljs (browser) and bb/JVM.

   Forms:  \"abc\" / \\a → escaped literal   ·  :digit :word :space :any :start :end :alpha … shorthand
     [:seq a b]  → ab            [:or a b]    → (?:a|b)
     [:* a] [:+ a] [:? a]        [:rep a 2 4] → a{2,4}
     [:class \\a \\b :digit] → [ab\\d]   [:not …] → [^…]   [:group a] → (a)   [:lit \"a.b\"] → a\\.b"
